## Configuration

The file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jellyfin-find-duplicates.conf`
(which is usually `~/.config/jellyfin-find-duplicates.conf`)
is sourced as a bash script if it exists.

An example is distributed as `jellyfin-find-duplicates.conf.example`
it can be copied into place with

    cp jellyfin-find-duplicates.conf.example $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jellyfin-find-duplicates.conf

and then edited.

The following variables are then expected to exist:

- `JELLYFIN_HOST`
  The Jellyfin URL scheme and hostname for the server,
  with no trailing slash.
  Example: `https://jellyfin.local`
- `JELLYFIN_TOKEN`:
  The Jellyfin API token.
  One can be made via the Jellyfin dashboard, at "Advanced" â†’ "API Keys".
  Example: `abc123abc123`
- `JELLYFIN_USER`:
  The name of the Jellyfin user to use as context.
  Example: `bob`
- `JELLYFIN_SHOWS_LIB_NAME`:
  The name of the TV shows library in Jellyfin.
  Example: `Shows`

The following are optional:

- `IGNORED_PATHS`:
  Any paths to files which are known wanted duplicates,
  separated by double colons (`::`).
  For example, if there are two versions of an episode, one can be ignored:
  `/path/to/episode (duplicate version).mkv`.
  If there are multiple, ignore all but one:
  `/path/to/episode (version 2).mkv::/path/to/episode (version 3).mkv`.
  Paths are Jellyfin's full media paths, as reported in this script's output
  when duplicates are found.


## Dependencies

- `curl`, which you probably have. If not, it is in every package manager.
  Run `apt install curl` or equivalent.
- `jq`, the JSON toolkit, which you may not have.
  Run `apt install jq` or equivalent.

## Compatibility

So far this is only tested on Linux.
It may work on other platforms.

- Improve speed
- Improve output
- Also notice any missing episodes
